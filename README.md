# Garden Linux Release

A [BOSH](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/) release for deploying [Garden Linux](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux).

To deploy Garden Linux to its own virtual machine follow the [Vagrant BOSH instructions](docs/vagrant-bosh.md). Alternatively, to deploy Garden Linux to a Garden container in a virtual machine follow the [BOSH lite instructions](docs/bosh-lite.md).

Either way, when you're done, Garden Linux should be running and you can create containers, run a process in a container, and so on via the [REST API](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden#rest-api).
